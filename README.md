# blackhole

A fast DNS sinkhole/honeypot for Linux and macOS. The policy engine is pure
Rust and the wire/runtime edge uses Proxima from
[`brianbruggeman/proxima`](https://github.com/brianbruggeman/proxima); the
default Prime path has no Tokio dependency. DNS over UDP and TCP share one
bind.

This first slice intercepts DNS, the portable boundary used by Pi-hole and
AdGuard. It does not claim to transparently capture all IP traffic: that needs
OS firewall/TProxy setup and is deliberately a separate adapter boundary.

```sh
cargo run --release -- blackhole.example.toml
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5353 ads.example A
```

Use port 53 only with the platform's normal low-port capability mechanism.
The default configuration binds only to loopback. An explicitly supplied
configuration path must exist and parse successfully before the listener is
created. `ignore` is represented as a silent response by the current Proxima
DNS edge. When `policy.rules` is configured, it is authoritative and legacy
`mode`/`domains` are ignored; unmatched queries receive NODATA for
compatibility. Explicit `forward` rules use the opt-in Proxima upstream pipe
and fail closed when no upstream is attached.
